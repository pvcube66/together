## Architecture

Curtus uses a decoupled architecture. The frontend handles standard requests and UI state, while a standalone Node.js server acts as the WebRTC signaling layer and real-time state synchronizer. Video feeds are established via direct peer-to-peer connections to minimize server bandwidth.

## Known Limitations

- **Video Capacity Restrictions**: Video calls utilize a peer-to-peer (P2P) WebRTC mesh network architecture. Because each participant must send and receive streams to every other participant, bandwidth and CPU usage scale exponentially. Therefore, video streams are limited to a maximum of 4 concurrent users per room to maintain performance and client stability.
- **Microphones Intentionally Disabled**: To strictly preserve the quiet, distraction-free "study library" atmosphere, audio transmission (microphones) is permanently disabled. Communication is strictly limited to text chat and visual accountability.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `v20.x`
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Postgres Database**: Local instance or hosted (e.g., Neon)
- **Redis**: Local instance or hosted (e.g., Upstash)

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies for both the Next.js application and the Socket.IO server:

```bash
# Install Next.js dependencies
npm ci

# Install socket server dependencies
npm ci --prefix server
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required configuration:**
- `DATABASE_URL` / `PRISMA_DATABASE_URL`: Postgres connection string.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` / `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: Authentication credentials.
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN`: Redis connection parameters.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL`: Public URIs for the frontend and socket server.

*(Note: OAuth keys such as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` are optional but required for social login).*

### 3. Database Initialization

Generate the Prisma client and optionally seed the database:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Seed initial data
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Running Development Servers

Curtus requires both the Next.js web server and the Socket.IO server to run concurrently.

**Terminal 1 (Next.js Application):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Socket.IO Server):**
```bash
npm run dev --prefix server
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start the Next.js application in development mode.
- `npm run build` — Create a production build of the Next.js application.
- `npm start` — Run the compiled Next.js application.
- `npm run check` — Execute ESLint and TypeScript type checking.
- `npm test` — Run Vitest unit and integration tests.
- `npm run format` — Format the codebase using Prettier.

---

## Observability

This repository implements a robust observability pipeline:

- **Structured JSON Logs**: Unified logging across web and socket servers with correlation parameters (`request_id`, `trace_id`, `room_id`).
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry traces exported to Grafana Cloud Tempo.
- **Metrics**: Socket server exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint via `GET /metrics`.

Refer to `docs/observability.md` and `docs/observability-runbook.md` for complete setup instructions.
